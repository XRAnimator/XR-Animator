XR Animator is a motion capture application designed for VTubing and XR/3D experiences.  
It uses machine learning to detect 3D poses from a webcam feed and animates 3D avatars (MMD/VRM models) in real time.  
You can track your face, hands, or entire body depending on your needs.

## About the Project

XR Animator grew out of **System Animator**, originally a desktop gadget project over a decade ago.  
It evolved from a simple CPU meter into a complete XR/3D tool: system meters, music visualizers, AR demos, animated wallpapers, and now full-body motion tracking.
